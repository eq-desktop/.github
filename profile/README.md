## 🌌 What is eq-desktop?

**eq-desktop** is a collective effort to bring **elegance, ownership, and freedom** back to the Linux desktop.  

We believe in **Equora** — the idea that your system, your account, and your identity should always be **yours**. No lock-in, no walled gardens.  

Our projects aim to combine the polish of commercial OSes with the transparency and flexibility of Linux.
